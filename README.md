# PL/SQL Course

Welcome to the PL/SQL Course! This repository is designed to help you learn Oracle PL/SQL from the basics to advanced concepts. PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. It combines the data manipulation power of SQL with the processing power of procedural languages.

This course is structured in a logical sequence, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to advanced topics. Each topic is covered in a dedicated markdown file for easy navigation and focused learning.
